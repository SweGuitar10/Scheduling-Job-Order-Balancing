This project was created as part of our bachelor thesis, where we aimed to create a scheduling solution for an assembly line where the starting time of jobs needs to be scheduled according to a set of constraints.
Two approaches were chosen, an exact one, Constraint Programming, implemented using Google-OR-tools, and an approximate one, Genetic Algorithm, implemented using the GeneticSharp library.

Jean-Paul Hanna implemented the Genetic Algorithm solution.
Kurt Areskog Implemented the Constraint Programming solution.
